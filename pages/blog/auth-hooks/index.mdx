## what're we making

a great use case for using React's context and hook api is to create an authentication component. inn this post we'll create a flexible react module that executes callbacks in response to a user's status.

first, let's spec out some requirements and assumptions:

### requirements

- works for server side rendering and client transitions
- supports a variety of user statuses (blocked, missing strong auth, ...)
- does not flash unauthorized content before taking an action
- supports timer based strong authentication[^1]
- minimal external dependencies

### assumptions

- server will make a user authentication api call pre-rendering react
- apis are properly protected regardless of frontend views; frontend authorization makes for a better user experience
- browser can trust the initial server side auth api call and does not have to re-auth

## creating the provider



[^1]: authentication that requires a user has typed their password within the last X minutes.
